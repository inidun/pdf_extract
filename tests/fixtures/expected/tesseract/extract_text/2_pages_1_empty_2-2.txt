exchange information on innovative agri-
cultural methods that are gradually gai-
ning ground among local farmers. Some
850 primary schools and 20 high schools
are up and running, while day-care
centres and community restaurants are
easing women’s load of household chores.
The authorities can no longer sideline
the MST when it comes to agricultural
issues. By building a participatory and
egalitarian structure that goes against the
grain, it offers alternative perspectives to
broad swathes of Brazilian society. Its
adversaries denounce its political radica-
lism and illegal methods, while its defen-
ders call it Latin America’s most promi-
sing social movement. Brazilian econo-
mist Celso Furtado goes so far as to say
that it offers “the only answer to mass
unemployment in Brazil” because “a
return to subsistence agriculture is prefe-
rable to urban poverty.” The MST is
facing this challenge with the slogan of
“Agrarian reform: everyone’s struggle.” »
