Close Links Traced
Between Early
Greek=Syrian Cultures
VER since its foundation one of Unesco's principal objects has
IL been to demonstrate to the nations that they do not exist in
isolation and to induce in them a. certain unity of spirit by
reminding them that civilizations, so far from being closed systems
evolving independently, are mutually accessible and enrich each
other by exchange.

ern thought, however
imperfectly, long be-
fore Europe could
make direct contact
with them at the time
of the Renaissance.
In thus passing on
the fruits of Hellenic-'"...wis'uuiii, mmtuc',. ii
the intellectual history of hu-
manity, were the agents of that
"historic continuity.. which is one
of the major achievements of mo-
dern science. Yet those who no-
tice dates cannot have failed, in
reading the previous article, men-
tioned above to be struck by a- break in that continuity.
Between the closing of the phi-
losophy schools of Athens, de-
creed by Justinian in 529 A. D.,
and the Arab renaissance, which
flowered in Baghdad in the se-
cond half of the Eighth Century,
more than two centuries passed,
during which time the Maslem
world was fully occupied in con-
quering the Mediterranean basin.
It had neither time nor occasion
to take much interest in the
"wisdom of the Ancients, ulumal-awa'il", from which Islamic
orthodoxy at first tended rather
to recoil.
What them during these two
: centuries was the fate of Greek
thought ? Who kept it alive ? The
Syriac-speaking Christians of
Mesopotamia.
Singular Universities...
Christianity appeared very
early in Mesopotamia. The point
from which it first spread was
the little kingdom of Osrohene,
y whose capital Edessa (now Urfa)became officially Christian at
the end of the Second Century.
From this ancient centre of Se-
mitic culture, little affected by
- Hellenization, from which it was
protected by its language, Syriac,
akin to Aramaic and Hebrew,
Christianity spread through all
the lands watered by the Tigris
and Euphrates.
On the Fifth Century theologi-
cal disputes concerning the na-
ture of Christ gave rise to schism.
The Persian churches adopted
the Nestorian belief (today repre-
ænted by about 100, 000 faithful
dwelling around Lakes Van and
Urmiah), while those of Upper
Mesopotamia embraced the doo-
< (1) cr. the Arab Cultural Beritare ;
'Yol I, No. 3, April 148
One of the dearest proofs of
this truth is the historic example
þf the contacts between Arab
Mind Western civilization, of which
an account was given to the rea-
ders of the Unesco Courier (1 ;
in connection with Unesco's nexb
meeting at Beirut. At a time
when the dominant idea of man-
kind was religion, could there be
two worlds more in opposition
than the Islamic and the Chris-
'Üan, eachhaviDg a different
concept of the Godhead and each
regarding the other as pagan
and idolatrous ?
Yet those two worlds did not
remain in ignorance of each
other ; they lived side by side
from the time when the sons of
the Prophet occupied all the peri-
phery of the Mediterranean. From
their frequent contacts, Europe
gained material wealth and in-
tellectual concepts which we use 
daily almost without realizing it.
The most important element of
this legacy from the Arab to the
Western world is without any
doubt the intellectual element
consisting of the sum of know-
ledge inherited from Greece and
transmitted to Mediaeval Europe
through the Arab scientists and
philosophers of Spain. Encyclo-
paedic intellects such as Avicenna
(Ibn Sina, 980-1037), Averroes
(Ibn Raschid), Atempace (Ibn
Badja, 1138), as versed in phy-
sical science as in metaphysical
speculation, transmitted to the
Latins the richest treasures of
Greece in science and philosophy.
Thanks to them Euclid, Archi-
medes, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Ga-
len, Aristotle and Plato
trines of Jacobite Monopnysism.
It was in these surroundings,
traditionally closed to Greek in-
fluence alike by language and by
political and geographical situa-
tion, that classical culture was
kept alive. Syrian converts to
Christianity had to learn Greek
to read the Old and New Testa-
ment and the writings of the Fa-
thers, and this introduced them
simultaneously to science and
philosophy.
From the Fifth Century
onwards there was a veritable
positive outburst of phil-HeIIe-
nism, whose principal centre was
the Persian School set up at
EdeS5a and later at Nisibe and
Gandishapur in Iran. In these
singular schools, where thousands
of students lived cloistered like
monks and which might be deem-
ed the first univet'sities since
the disappearance of the schools
of Alexandria, Athens and Per-
gamos, there was taught, in addi-
tion to strictly ecclesiastical learn-
ing, all the science of Greece.
Verbal teaching was backed up
by a vast labour of translation.
Works on dialectics, logic, astro-
logy and medicine were rendered
from Greek into Syriac. The
manuscripts which contain them
aJ"e today the ; richest treasure of
the great libraries of London,
Paris and the Vatican, and some
of them date from the Sixth
Century.

The transformation wrought in

sOlpotamia and Persia.---.
by the Arab invasion
reduced this activity"
little, but did riot en-
tirely suppress it, par-
ticularly among the
estorians. Though the
first successors of the
Pt'ophet retained his
simple way of life, op-
posed to all material
civilizatton and ail'worldly learn-
ing, the Ommeyads, established at
Damascus from 660, converted
Islam into a centralized temporal
State, with an army of official
recruited principally from Greek
and Syriac-speaking Christians.
Soon the Court of Damascus took
on the appearance of a Byzan-
tine Court in an Arab country.
The revolution of 750, whence
sprang the Abbassid Caliphate,
accentuated in Islam this ten-
dency towards a political system
along the lines of oriental des-
potism. In Baghdad, founded by
AI Mansur in 762, the Caliph be-
came as it were a reincarnation
of the Sassanian King of Kings.
Like him, he had his harem, his
gardens, his hunting, a sump-
tuous palace, in which were piled
the treasures and the arts of
Central Asia, the Indies and even
China.
Against this fabulous back-
ground, worthy of the Arabian
Nights, there moved a brilliant
Court, where pleasant living was
inconceivable without the pleas-
ures of the mind. Poets were wel-
comed there. It was there that
primitive Arab poetry, rude and
warlike, gave birth to Court poe-
try, flexible and playful,"tight
as the tracery of the Athambra".
There, too, philosophic throught
took wings, exploring problems
undreamt of by the first readers
of the Koran. And it was this
atmosphere of intellectual enqui-
ry that the works of Greek anti-
quity were translated from Syriac
into Arabic.
The part played by Syriac-
speaking Christians, whom mem-
bers of Unesco will find at Bei-
rut represented by the Maroni : es
of the Lebanon, in no way de-
tracts from the importance of the
Arab world in transmitting the
Greek heritage. Without it, the
vast labour accomplished by its
teachers, the Syrians of Mesopo-
tamia, would have rested a dead
letter, hidden in a tongue hardly
known in the West before the
16th Century Renaissance.

Dr. Cheng
Describes Close
Cooperation
Between China
and Unesco
II NSPffiATION for the United
Nations may rightfully date
back to the time of Confu-
cius when, some two thousand
yeaes ago, the great Chinese
thinker spoke of the world as a
"single family". Such is the opi-
nion of Dr. Cheng Chi-Pao, who
is now in Paris to develop closer
co-operation between his country
and Unesco.
Dr. Cheng, as Secretary-General
of the Chinese National Commis-
sion for Unesco, is well acquaint-
ed with the efforts of China to
participate actively in the family
of nations and to share with
all other peoples the treasures of
her past and her present. While
in Paris he has reported to Unes-
co on the achievements of China
towards strengthening interna-
tional co-operation, t
The Chinese National Commis-
sion, first organized in August,
1947, has 120 elected members,
leaders in the fields of education,
science and culture. Divided into
six committees, each representing
one of the major fields of Unesco
activity, the Commission is head-
ed by Dr. Chu Chia-Hua, Minister
of Education. Its purpose is to
make effective the programme of
Unesco in China.
Reviewing the activities of
China in recent years towards in-
ternational understanding and co-
operation, Dr. Cheng referred to
developments in each of the six
programme fields.
In the field of Fundamental
Education, he recalled, Unesco
and China had jointly called a
Regional Conference (September,
1947), bringing together experts
from the entire Far East and
Pacific areas to discuss common
problems and to develop techni-
ques and materials in mass educa-
tion. China was also developing,
in close co-operation with Unesco,
a"pilot project"to try out me-
thods in bringing a basic mini-
mum of education and commun-
ity living to under-privileged
peoples.

Some Historic Elements
of Persian Painting
As a World Influence
JIiìERSIAN painting is a new discovery for Westerners and perhapsI even to some extent to the Persians themselves, When in 1910
the Germans held an exhibition of Persian art in Berlin the
appreciative eyes of a great many people were turned towards it,
especially when the Impressionists and the Expressionists had already
widened the scope of their perception. Since then the French and the
English have shown their interest in Persian art either by hOlding
similar exhibitions or have attempted to study the subject itself.
Persian painting is in its essence romantic. In its fully matured
stage it possesses a delicate touch of reality. This appeared towards
the end of 15th century and continued throughout 16th, when Behzad
of Herat, the master artist of Timur's court brought the sense of
movement, after the manner of Chinese, to his paintings.
He developed tne cnaraCLenz,,-
tion of his figures, introduced
landscape and released the art
from the restriction of beag mere-
ly illustrations of texts. Rich
blue and gold background became
generally accepted as the condi-
tion and the carefully coloured
red background, which prevailed
for a century if not abandoned
was skillfully moderated to new
fashion.
The art of the age draws the
season of gaiety where you have
the element of spring even in
your summer and winter, where
it is a love-scene or a battlefield,
a silver-like brightness is over the
white-flowers and the
leaves are ornamented
with shining diamonds.
Day and night are
often equally bright,
rocks are risen to meet
the blue sky, and little
brooks are rippling
while grass shoots up
in tender growth.-...,..--
The element of space
is reduced only to a fantasy and
everything is brought under your
eyes. A distant tree in the Euro-
pean art remains remote always,
lost and insignificant and its
values merely lie in the atmo-
phece which it creates in relation
to the main theme. This is the
normal attitude of the European
painter and shows strict fidelity
to nature.
But to the Persian artist a tree
or a figure behind the object is
always large and fascinating In
itself so that is shows a value
equal to that of the main theme.
This is held among, many reasons,
to belong to the creative and the
free spirit of the artist who looks
at nature purely from the ange
of his own imagination. But
there is a strong influence of
Chinese here, the fact that the
spectator is placed at the point f
vantage above what is represent-
ed. He looks down as if from a
raised platform so that not only
all the figures and object on dif-
ferent planes could be seen with-
out confusion but also the other
side of the curtain would be re-
vealed as well.
AnimBI Forms and
Geometric Patterns
The history of painting is very
old in Persia but by no means
easy to trace. A continuous tra-
dition from the Sassanian period
may be traced supported by sa-
tisfactory evidence, the relics of
which are to be found most abun-
dantly in 12th and 13th Centuries.
The most striking manifestations
of this early art were animal
forms and geometric patterns.
Herzfeld has traced to Sassanians
many wall paintings of dancing
girls, huntresses and floral deco-
rations of various kinds. But usu-
By
Akbar
M. OSKOUl
ally the Manichean artist Mani
is held by Persians to be the first
master artist. His illuminated
books being burned and he him-
self persecuted due to his religious
beliefs (A. D. 290), nothing re-
mains to us of his"Arjang"as
the collection of his painting was
called. In his time Persian paint-
ing is supposed to have developed
as the servant of religion, because.
later on when Islam was intro
duced into the country, painting
was denounced on the authority
of Hadith, though not specifical-
ly by Quran, (there is no clear
prohibition of painting in the
Quran) by the leaaers
of religion as some-
ching allied to idol-
atry.
To admire a repre-
sentation of the hu-
man figure was apt
to result in the wor-
ship of that figure.
Since then the reli-
gious authorities have
never ceased to frown on painting.
A man during this era, would
not be so much represented as
indicated.
But the religion did not ban
painting altogether. It only li-
mited its subject-matter to de-
signs. Calligraphy starts from
here.
Illustrations for Basra and
Kula Quran Manuscripts
Toward the end of the 7th Cen-
tury in Iraq, Basra and kufa
Quran manuscripts with beauti-
ful designs and decorations began
to appear, and religion and art
for a few centuries worked to-
gether in perfect harmony.
Faith, the essential element of aH
forms of artistic inspiration, was
restored, and the artist was con-
fident to work towards something
sublime. He no more had the
fever of an undecided artist t0
whom the whole world is given
to be represented, while his spirit
is divided and his attention dis-
tracted. His was a strong faith
and his task specific.
In the 14th and 15th Centuries,
art succeeded in releasing itself
from the narrow lines drawn JY
theologians and developed rapidly.
National literature was revived
with genuine enthusiasm. The
epic Shah-Nameh of Firdousi was
frequently illustrated with repro-
sentations of Persian heroes. N1-
zami and Khadju Kermani be-
came increasingly common sun-
jects of painting. The pair of
lovers, Khosro and Shirin, Leila
and Majoun were favourite sub-
jects with artists.
Strong Chinese Inl'ueMe
The Chinese influence has been
great on Persian painting and
miniatures but it was not fO
strong as to destroy the tradi-
tion, while on the other hand t
enriched the hands of master ar-
tists like Behzad and to some
extent Reza and the art stin.. e-
mained Persian in its nature.
The decline came suddenly and
since then Persian painting has
not yet risen to its past glory. Th< :,
decline was after Shah Abbas Saf-
vid's reign.
In the 18th century, European
painting and engravings were slav-
ishly copied and the typical them ? s
worked by artists were voluptuous
women of indolent expression, the
artist attempting unsuccessfully
to combine a type of occidental
and oriental beauty.
