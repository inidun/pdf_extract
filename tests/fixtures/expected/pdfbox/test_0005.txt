"initiating methods of interna-

them."
To fulfil these aims, Unco hay
developed the following methods
in the field of the natural scion-
ces :
Grants-in-aid : A grant-in-aid Is
an outright pavment to a non-
governmental or semi-governmen-
tal international organization in
furtherance of Unesco's constitu-
tional objectives and general pro-
gram of work, for purposes spe-
cified in each case, and without
financial return.
A grant-in-aid may be awarded
to give"assistance to internation-
al organizations for initiating
and operating facilities for the
world-wide pooling and co-ordina-
tion qf already-acquired know-
ledge, the promotion of cultural
interchange, the standardization
of terms, techniques and appara-
tus ; the maintaining and ex-
changing of living samples and in-
animate objects ; and the upkeep
of laboratories and other institu-
tions under international control,
by means of grants for interna-
tional education, scientifie and
cultural institutions and bureaux.
It is understood that no grants
so given may be devoted to the
expenses of original research of
creative activity being carried out
in a country by citizens of that
country in public or private insti-
tutions financed by governmental
or private funds of that coun-
try".
Contracts : This is an arrange-
ment under which Unesco makes
a payment to an educational,
scientific or cultural organization
for the fulfilment, at Unesco's re-
quest, of a task, service, or pur-
pose specified in each Mse and
closely linked with the Prramme
of Unesco as approved by the
General Conference.
Contracts"may be concluded
with non-governmental or semi-
governmental international orga-
nizations which have been grant-
ed consultative status for :
1) the organization of interna-
tional conferences, congresses,
symposia, expert committees, etc. ;
2) the organization of the Ex-
change of Persons'programme
through promotion and adminis-
tration of travel grants, fellow-
ships, etc. ;
3) the execution of surveys, in-
vestigations or other studies ;
4) the preparation and public-
tion of periodicals. books or other
material ;
5) the development of new in-
ternational organization'.
From a careful study of the
above rules it will be seen that
only under exceptional circum-
stances can Unesco funds be said
to be directly involved in original
scientific research.
Scientists and engineers, when
they join the Unesco Secretariat,
leave their instruments and slide
rules behind. They only carry
with them a knowledge of the
scientific method, a familiarity
with some of the implications of
science in the modern world, and
a faith that relations between
peoples can be improved.

After examinatio  of scientific
I aspects of the Institute's project-
ed activities, the Conference pre-
pared the following general re-
1 commendations :
That scientific expeditions : n
the Hylean Amazon be carried
out preferably by teams of scien-
tists and in limited geographical
areas ;
'That research be concerned with
matters of general interest, e. g.
problems relating to hydro-bio-
logy, the general nutritional con-
ditions of the Amawnian peoples
and the agricultural problems
connected therewith ;
That in 1948 scientists appoint-
ed by Unesco carry out research
work in a selected area of the
River Huallaga region of Peru ;
That the formation of a biblio-
graphical index be put in hand
forthwith at Manaus with the
co-operation of the scientific
bodies ;
That a yearly sum be set aside
for the publication of unpublish-
ed works and scientific documents
on Amazonia.
National membership in the
Institute, according to the terms
of its Convention, is open to any
, MLlerrar ;
Member State of the United Na-
tions or a U. N. Specialized Agen-
cy.
The IIHA Council is the highest
authority of the Institute, deter-
mining its general policies,
supervising financial matters and
receives the reports on research in
the Amazon basin.
A seven-member Executive Com-
mittee is designed to make policy
decisions between the meetings vf
the Council.
A Director of the Institute 18
to be elected, on nomination o1f
the Executive Committee, by the
Council, and he shall direct the
Institute's activities under the
Council's guidance.
Although Unesco's role in the
creation of the Institute was es-
pecially a preparatory one, the
Institute"shall conclude, as soon
as practicable, an agreement with
Unesco".
The Convention also establish-
ed an Interim Commission to
function until the first session f
the Council of the Institute, which
- it was anticipated-would be
held in the first half of 1949.
SOCIAL STUDIES PLANNED
OF AMAZON PEOPLES S
By Dr. Charles Wagley
[Dr. Charles Wagley, Columbia University anthropologit, and
Dr. Eduardo Galvao of Brazil are carryiufJ out, under, the auspices
of the Unesco Hylean Amazon Project, a communit1/study in the
lower AmazOn region in Brazil. The survey will aid in the formation
of a research programme to be carried out in other areas of the
Amazon basin by th< ! recent/y'e5tablished I. I. H, A. Before leaving for
Brazil, Dr. Wagley made the following observations regarding research
in that part of the world. ],
THE tropical environment, thepeculiar historial development
offer unusual circumstances for
social and natural sciences.
Such research should focu on
man and his past, present and
potential adjustment to the Ama-
zon environment. To study t..'1is
general problem, it will be neces-
sary to call upon many scientists
with a variety of specialities. Bo-
tanists must study the plants
which are used now, which have
been used by the Indians in the
past, and which may be useful
to man in the future.
Soil experts must furnish us
with an analysis of the earth
from the point of view of present
and future agricultural produc-
tion, and agronomists must tell
us what is good and bad about
the present techniques of tilling
the soil and must seek new me-
thods for greater and more effec-
tive production.
Nutritionists will study the
vitamin, mineral and energy con-
tent of Amazon foods and will
tell us what foods are appro-
priate for the Amazon. Physiolo-
gists will study the energy output
and other physiologically deter-
mined reactions of man under
Amazon conditions. Each science
has a definite contribution to
make to this general prouiem.
By focusing on the problem of
man in relation to the Amazon
environment we do not limit the
number of scientists and sciences
which would participate in the
program, but at the same time
we do not try to work toward an
encyclopedic knowledge of the
Amazon without the benefit of a
limiting problem.
In such a program, one of the
first steps would seem to be a
study of the contemporary cul-
ture, or way of life, of the pre-
sent population of the Amazon
Valley.
Three racial stocks have con-
tributed to the contemporary
Amazon population, and the mo-
dern culture contains elements
inherited from Portugal or Spain,
from Africa, and from the Ame-
rican Indian.
Newcomers to the Amazon are
soon forced to adopt many
caboclo customs and habits. Fur-
thermore, any social planning
must take into consideration the
habits, values, customs, beliefs
and in general the organized way
of life of the people who are
there.
Therefore, the problem of the
social anthropologists in coopera-
tion with other scientists in the
Amazon would seem to be two de-
vast uninhabited territory, and the
of the Hylean Amazon region
research in many disciplines of the
termine the basic patterns ut me
present culture and to be able
in the future to advise social
planners as to the feasibility of
programs of change in this re-
gion. Like the physiological orga-
nism, human culture has envy-
ronmental limitations and envi-
rorunental reactions, and It must
be handled with care.
In order to determine the basic
culture of the Amazon region,
studies will have to be made by
social anthropologists in several
Amazon communities within the
next few years.
In making these studies the
following major points must be
covered :
1) History of the region ;
2) Sustenance and basic eco-
nomy (agriculture, fishing,
collecting of forest products,
commercial system, etc.) ;
3) Diet and Food habits (objec-tive stu y f food consum d,
food taboos, preparation of
foods, cost, etiquette, etc.) ;
4) Social Life (education, fa-
mily life, social position and
prestige, social classes, clubs,
religious organizations, neign-
bourt100d groups, municipal
and community solidarity,
etc.) ;
5) The Individual Life (birth
child training, courtship,
marriage, relations between
the sexes, old age, death and
mourning, etc.) ;
6) Religious Life (church orga-
nizations, religious festivals,
cults, mythology and folk-
lore, etc.).
The arrow is still the main weapon for hunting in the Hylean Amazon
Region.
