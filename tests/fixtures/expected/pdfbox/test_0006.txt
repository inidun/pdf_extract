offered by this Conference of

DJons from one nation to another
: far of the greatest value.
! foe IBE with its long experi-
ence, its surveys, and its confer-
ences, has already done fine work
m the field of educational re-
ge6u'ch. However, these activities
can usefully be supplemented by
unesco's more practical pro-
gramme".
Mr. Piaget, Director of the In-
ternational Bureau of Education,
agreed with Dr. Beeby that im-
portant results could emerge from
close Unesco-IBE co- {) peration.
I'in the field of education", he
said,"example should play a mare
important role than compulsion. I
am convinced that solutions suit-
able to the different conditions
obtsinir_g in the various countries
tthould be studied, without any
attempt to impose a uniform sys-
term",
The Conference then heard re-
ports of educational developments
in various countries during the
past year. Questions followed and
øome of the most interesting
points mentionned were these :
Australia.-The school leaving
ege was 15 in New South Wales
and Victoria and the possibility of
prolonging school attendance un-
taL that age in other States was
being examined... besides the State
colleges for training in academic
sttbjects, the secondary education
system included special schools
tor agriculture, trades, etc... a new
riment is being carried out in
J1rses for immigrants.
Belgium-Holiday parties for
lrOrkers are a new experiment for
tbð spare time and holidays of
\9OUDg workers... school broadcast-
ing is organized differently in the
Walloon and Flemish parts of the
country-it was independent of the
Ministry of Education... medico-
pedagogic centres are being
organized in Brussels, Borinage
IDd near Antwerp.
Burma.-8eventy per cent of
the population can read and write,
due largely to the traditional edu-
cation provided in Buddhist mon-
asteries... the education of adults
is being carried out by broadcast
courses and with the help of the
Ypung People's Associations... lang-
uage instruction is difficult be-
cause there are one hundred and
twenty differents dialects.
Bulgaria.-Forty-five per cent
at university students have schol-
arships... illiteracy has been redu-
ced to fourteen percent... education
is obligatory to the age of fif-
teen... primary school teachers are
trained for two years ; secondary
teachers must first attend a uni-
versity.
France.-School reforms have
8Ct far affected pupils between the
ages of twelve and fifteen... tradi-
tional methods are so far being
retained for students above that
age... the experiment of the"New
Classes"had been carried out
this year at the level of the 4th
grade... a training course held for
teachers in charge of the direction
of the new classes had continued
its creative development particu-
larly as regards the co-ordination
of teaching, the study of environ-
ment and the part played by
artistic, plastic, or musical train-
ing.
At subsequent sessions, delegates
exchanged views on the Teaching
of Handwriting, School Psycholo-
gists and on the various problems
concerned with teaching about the
purpose and the work of the
United Nations. A Chinese speaker
suggested the creation of an in-
ternational documentation centre
regarding the UN and its Agen-
cies, and stressed that"much
courage and faith"would be ne-
cessary to overcome the cynicism
and disillusionment of those who
iII4 not bzlieve in such teaching.
. French delegate urged that it
was necessary to demonstrate that
there were three fundamental re-
requirements for international
peace : mutual assistance between
the nations, the surrender of some
degree of national sovereignty by
each country and the organiza-
tion of collective security.
A speaker from Brazil pointed
to the survey Unesco had carried}
out among its Member States re-j
garding their progress in develop-,
ing teaching programmes about
the United Nations."Unesco en-
countered several kinds of obsta-
cles", he said,"some of these were
moral, due to the scepticism with
which the United Nations was
viewed".
Reports received on educational
developments in the countries re-
presented will be published, as
also will the Conference's recom-
mendations on Teaching of Hand-
writing ; School Psychologists ; and
Development of International Un-
derstanding Among Young people
and Teaching about International
Organizations.

Letters from
The Readers
To the Editor of the Unesco
Courier :
.'... j.
Sir :
The Unesco Courier pu-
blished in its June numoer
(vol. 1, No 5) an interesting
article entitled'Work-Plan
for Germany'.
I would like to point out
that the'Federation de 1'Edu-
cation Nationale', whose Gene-
ral Secretary, M. Adrien La-
vergne, is a member of the
French National Commission
for Unesco, has given a good
deal of attention to the re-
education problem of German
youth.
A survey was made in all
four zones of occupation, in
June-July 1947. by a aeteKa'
tion of our Federation. This
delegation of seven members
was lead by Mile Mane-louse
Cavalier, permanent expert of
Unesco's Education Section at
the French National Commis-
sion and member of the tem-
porary Council of the interna-
tional voluntary organizations
dealing with Education, Scien-
ce and Culture.
The results of our survey
have been published in a re-
port of 300 pages entitled'AI-
lemagne 1947'. This book was
printed by the `society Uni-
I versitaire d'Edition et ue Li-
I brairie' (Sudel).
Moreover, the International
80mmission for the Study of
German School-Books... start-
d its survey in 1947. I have
: >fen appointed'rapporteur
general'on this question for
the Congress of the Interna-
tional Preparatory Commission
3n Teaching which is going to
take place in Budapest from
August 21 to 24, 1948.
Yours very truly,
Emil HOMBOURGER.
Professeur Agrégé de !'University.
Maurice Kurtz, author and play-
right, has been closelv associated
with preparations for the Inter-
national Theatre Institute since
the idea took tangible form in
1946. In the following article, he
explains something of the Insti-
tute's. purpose and something of
what it may accomplish.
THE International Theatre Institute is the newest organization onthe scene of international art. With its creation comes to a close
the two-year production-rehearsal period which focussed upon it the
attention of theatre artists, technicians and administrators the world
over.
It is an exciting experience to help transform into a living reality
the inevitably cold, conventional words of a conference resolution :
"It was resolved to call an international meeting of theatre
experts for the purpose of founding an International Theatre
Institute..." (First General Conference of Unesco, Nov. 1946,),
Many months of preliminary investigation and study went into
the early stages of the I. T. I., giving it its raison d'etre and the
concreteness which earned for it the active guidance of J. B. Priest-
ley, the enthusiasm and support of Armand Salacrou. Jean-Louis
Barrault, Clarence Derwent, Tyrone Guthrie and a host of others :
. professionals, amateurs, public.
A first"reading"of the lost. !.
took place last July when Unesco
invited twenty-five theatre experts
from fourteen countries in Eu-
rope, Asia. North and South
America, to decide for or against
"production".Within a few days, these busy,
practical-minded theatre folk put
together a programme aimed at
lowering, if not eliminating, the
obstacles which interfece with the
international movement of new
playscripts, opera and ballet
scores, performing companies. and
of the various types of informa-
tion leading to increased and
better professional relations be-
tween theatre circles of all coun-
tries, and therefore, between the
people of all countries who flock
to their theatres.
In the past year since the July
1947 Conference, I have had occa-
sion to learn with what genuine
eagerness many countries look to
the establishment of the I. T. I. In
fact, twelve of them have given
concrete proof of this by consti-
tuting national centres :
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile,
China, Czechoslovakia, France,
Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland,
United Kingdom, U. S. A.
Other countries, such as. : Argen-
tina, Bolivia, Denmack, Ethiopia,
Greece, Norway, the Netherlands,
Poland, Sweden, Uruguay, New
Zealand and the Philippines are
in various stages of organization
of their national centres.
The importance of these con-
tres, springing up like guideposts I
on all continents, has not yet be·n,
fully appreciated. For it is an
entirely new idea in the arts to
organize a precise, all-year theatre
programme whose object is to
serve the stage and its world
everywhere.
The Central headquarters is a
convenient tunnel, a clearing-
. house, if you prefer, but in any
case, not The Thing itself. Any
other view, I believe, would be
pretentious and unrealistic,
In other words, the I. T. I, s job
is to help each nation make
known, honestly and effectively
and quickly, its best theatrical
products : spoken, musical, ballet.
dance, amateur, puppets, etc...
The former Société Universelle
du Theatre made an admirable
between-the-wars attempt to
achieve a solid footing in inter-
national theatre, but met with
the insurmountable indifference
inherent to its day.
Now that many more nations
are convinced that man's happi-
ness on earth is inseparably
linked to good international con-
duct, this fresh and more mature
understanding of world problems
gives the I. T. I, a. better chance
Unesco Library School
Planned for Englan d
The first Unesco International
Summer School for Librarians.
will be held in England during
September, 1H<.
Some fifty working librarians,
drawn especially from war-devas-
tated countries, will come together
to study library techniques and
equipment during the month-long
meetings. Close cooperation in
sponsorship of the school is being
rr. aintained with the International
Federation of Library Associa-
tions.
Mr. Raymond Irwin, Director Of
the School of Librarianship, Uni-
versity Collee, London, will direct
the school which will be held suc-
cessively in London and Manches-
ter. Choice of participants win be
made by Unesco National Com-
missions or Co-operating B dies
in the member states of the ora-
nizalion and by library associa-
tions.
There will be lectures by the
school's own faculty and by addi-
tional lecturers. Also included
will be demonstrations, discussion
groups, visits to libraries, exhi-
bitions of equipment and of
documentary films. Each stu-
dent will be expected to bring a
written account of public library
development in his or her own
country.
Librarians who may wish to at-
tend the school should contact
their national library association
or their Unesco National Com-
mission which will furnish com-
plete details.

for development and success
than its pre. wan parent.
With the hoMing of the First
Congress a few days ago, the
programme is now set. The objec-
tives are clear. The work is be-
gun-but much more remains to
be done.
And it will be, so long as each
country has a National Centre
functioning as an active source
of international theatre liaison
between itself and the rest of
the world.

feeling.
In Mr. Honzl's brief welcoming
address to the delegates, he re-
viewed Czechoslovak theatrical
background from a historical point
of view, and said his country
wduld always welcome foreign
theatrical companies sucn as
have already often visited Cze-
choslovakia from Russia, Yugo-
slavia, France and England
Following the opening ad-
dresses. the Congress went into
working session. It agreed to
110ld twice-daily meetings during
the six-day conference, and the
proposed Charter for the Insti-
tute was immediately adopted

The Committee on Organiza-
tion recommended the establish-
ment of a National Theatre Cen-
tre in each Member-State.
The Committee on Information
emphasized that the National
Centres should compile lists of
all existing endowments, official
and unofficial, for foreign thea-
trical students within their coun-
tries. and should do everything
possible to promote the interna-
tional exchange of persons in
that field.
The Committee of Theatre Ar-
tists Abroad urged the National
Centres to call on their govern-
ments to reduce the obstacles
which block and hinder the free
movement of theatrical produc-
tions and companies from one
country to another.
Following the Committee work,
the Congress elected an eight-
man Executive Committee with
Armand Salacrou as its Chair-
man. Other members included :
