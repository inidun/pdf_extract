UNESCO COURIER Volume I.-No. 6
Technical Needs Workers
Report on Findings
[Editor's note : Unesco field workers have been visiting seventeen
countries throughout the world during the past months to obtain
first-hand, derailed information of the position of press, radio and
film for the Technical Needs'Commission. Philippe Soupaull, promi-
nent French author who has also edited a daily newspa, per and run
a radio station, tells in the following notes something of his impres-
ions after surveying five Caribbean countries for UneSCo. ]
GGLAD to meet you !"I think that describes the
reception I got in the various
Central American countries I
visited on mission as a Unesco
investigator. Now that the initials

name, they have acquired a kind II
of magic power.
I spoke the word as an"open :
Sesame"before the many doors
on which I knocked-and the
doors were opened.
Carrying a thick questionnaire,
I called on ministries, on trade
unions and statistical bureaux. In
asking them my hundreds of
questions, I had to overcome a
certain amount of uneasiness on
their part as they realized they
were being requested an amount
of research and compilation of in-
formation which was often con-
siderable.
I had sometimes to argue and
to stress the importance to Unes-
co's Mass Communications pro-
gramme of knowing the number
of newspapers in existence, the
size of their editions, the range
of broadcasting transmitters or
the status of the educational film.
But all the people I consulted
were extremely interested in the
results I had obtained. My com-
monest reward was to hear,
mixed with advice and explana-
tions, this kind of remark :
"You know, this information ls
really useful. It brings, out all
sorts of points which have never
before been cleared up."
To my mind. the value of the
investigation I undertook in the
countries of Central America lies
not only in the results obtained,
nor in the quality of the answers
to questionnaires and in the vari-
ous complementary notes accom-
panying them.
It is to be found also, I think,
in the person of the investigator,
which proves to governments, ins-
titutions of all kinds and to in-
individuals that, despite the
thousands of miles which lie be-
tween them and the Avenue Kle-
ber in Paris, Unesco takes an in-
terest in them, in their work, m
their needs, and in what they
have achieved.
The impression I got was that
the people I questioned were
glad to see that the nations form-
ing Unesco were concerned with
the special problems of countries,
in some cases far away in space
and time alike, from the main
international current.
I should like to thank all the
friends I met as an investigator,
who answered my questions with
such care and interest as only the
published report will fully de-
monstrate.
Indian... Pakistan...
Alexander Shaw, former film
adviser to the government of In-
dia and producer of several Bri-
tish documentaries, surveyed
Technical Needs in Pakistan and
India for Unesco. The following
are some of his impressions of
conditions in those countries :
There seems to be an enormous
potential for films in both cities
and rural areas in Pakistan.
Many films shown are of an
informational and feature na-
ture. The dances and songs of
India, with all their colour, figure
prominently in most films. The
Government made a formal re-
quest. that a Unesco-trained do-
cumentary expert be sent to Pa-
kistan to train a documentary
unit there, for only now is the
first newsreel company being
formed.
India, on the other hand, is the
second film-producing country in
the world. The three centres of
the industry are in Bombay, Ma-
dras and Calcutta where no fewer
than some 400 companies are
located.
Indian film production is in
the neighbourhood of 250 feature-
films yearly, and their average
length is nearly twice that of
Hollywood films. Although tech-
nical and photographic standards
are nearly as high as anywhere
in the world, there is little effort
to produce compJicated plots-due
probably to the fact that 86 %
of the population (340 million) is
illiterate.
Some two thousand cinemas
serve the population, showing
only an occasional foreign film,
and these few are usually Bri-
tish or American.
Italy... Hungary...
Picrrè Artigue, Belgian foreign
correspondent and radio com-
mentator, carried out the surveys
in Italy and Hungary this year
for Unesco. Here in brief are
some of his observations made
after his return to Paris.
An outstanding impression ês
that both Italy and Hungary are
making a great effort to revive
and expand their mass communi-
cation systems.
Italy is seriously hampered by
a shortage of trained personnel
and printing equipment, although
radio networks have attained
their pre-war level.
In Hungary nearly nine-tenths
of all broadcasting equipment we
destroyed during the war. Yet
because of the lack of schools,
lessons are broadcast by radio
throughout large parts of the
country.
Hungary has produced the
world's lightest typewriter (barely
six pounds) made of aluminium.
The machine is inexpensive and,
tooling now completed, it will be
placed on sale this fall.
Unesco House serves as a clearing house for much reconstruction ma-
terials. Above shows the departure of a shipment of books for war-
emptied libraries.
B XLE rHUXLEY
VISITS
CENTRAL
EUROPE
Dr. Julian Huxley, Director-Ge-
neral, undertook during June a
three-week official tour of five
central and eastern European
countries to meet with govern-
ment leaders and to develop clo-
ser co-operation between Unesco
and the countries. The visit in-
cluded Yugoslavia, Hungary, Aus-
tria, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
The Director-General was able
to acquaint himself with the me-
thods of teaching and research
favoured in those countries and to
note the work being done to safe-
guard the heritage of folk art and
folklore and to preserve nature.
In those countries already having
National Commissions, these were
invited to special meetings where
Dr. Huxley was able to ease their
work in the early stages by spea-
king to them in detail of the
tasks to be accomplished and of
the best methods to be used in
the light of experience elsewhere.
On other occasions, contact was
made with most eminent repre-
sentatives of the intellectual
world who will furnish the nucleas
of future National Commissions
Dr. Huxley took the opportunity
also to recruit willing aid and
expert ability in making effective
the Unesco programme, and to
encourage certain countries to
ratify their membership in Unes-
co in final form.
Wherever he went, the Direc-
tor-General was received with the
utmost warmth and was able to
measure the goodwill and en-
thusiasm with Wl1lcn Unesco's
work is welcomed.
'Reconstruction Problems
in Southeast Asia
By Mary TREVELYAN
WTHEN Occidentals ta ! k of the
"war-devastated countries, most
of them think automatically of
Europe, some extend their
thinking to China, but few im-
mediately think in terms which
include South East Asia. The
problems of Europe are so great
and so urgent and are so con-
stantly in our minds that it is
difficult to remember the equally
great problems of countries so
remote from us geographically.
But Unesco, an international
organization, is interested in all
war-devastated countries, whether
in the West or the East and, as
soon as it was feasible, a survey
visit was arranged to five war-
devastated countries in the Far
East.
The five countries surveyed
were Burma, Malaya, Sarawak,
North Borneo and the Philip-
pines. The tour took exactly six
months, from November 6th 1947
to May 6th 1948. More than
30, 000 miles were covered, a great
many by air, approximately
5, 000 by road and 500 by river.
All the countries visited, with
the exception of Malaya, have
Sustained a very great deal of
material damage to school build-
ings. Malaya has been fortunate
in that respect, but has had a
full share of damage due to de-
terioration during the war. Many
ancient and historic cities in
Burma have been razed to the
ground. All the small villages up
and down the coast of Sarawak
were totally wrecked by bombing.
Sandakan, the old capital of
North Borneo, was 100% destroy-

the war.
Canadian Campaign
For School Help'
A campaign by the Cana-
dian Council for Reconstruction
through Unesco and the Cana-
dian Appeal for Children has
raised a million dollars which
will be spent to help restore edu-
cational facilities and standards
in countries which suffered most
heavily during the war.
Allocations of the fund, which
was collected by some seventy
voluntary agencies in a nation-
wide campaign, include :
to elementary and secondary
school supplies-$300, 000 ;
ftllowships for key personnel
to follow 6-month study courses
in Canada-$182, 000 ;
to university supplies, including
books and scientific equipment-
$150, 000 ;
for book projects, including a
book exchange scheme to collect
and send overseas half a million
volumes-$66. 750 ;
to art supplies, food and cloth-
ing for needy artists-$46, 250 ;
to assist Unesco's educational
reconstruction programme in Eu
rope and Asia-$25, 000.
Microfilm Readers
To Twelve Countries
Libraries and universities In
twelve war-wrecked countries have
been allocated thirty microfilm
readers by Unesco to assist the
rehabilitation of their services. An
additional eighteen readers have
been ordeced and will be allocat-
ed to other libraries shortly.
Countries in which the receiv-
ing libraries are located include
Austria, Belgium, China, Czecho-
slovakia, France, Greece, Hun-
gary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway,
Philippines and Poland. The in-
struments, useful to libraries in
areas where books are in short
supply, were bought by Unesco in
Paris as part of its reconstruction
programme.
Scouts Join TICER
The Boy Scouts International
Bureau has joined the Temporary
International Council for Educa-
tional Reconstruction (TICER)
and, through the efforts of its
nearly five million members, will
greatly strengthen the Council's
work in war-devastated regions.
The TICER, an association of
26 international voluntary agen-
cies engaged in educational re-
construction, works in co-opera-
tion with Unesco and has head-
quarters at Unesco House in Paris.
Council members represent over
700 national organizations in
more than 60 countries.
Since early 1944, the Boy Scout
movement has conducted relief
work in seven devastated Euro-
pean countries, including organiz-
ation of child refugee centres and
aiding youth education program-
mes in displaced persons'camps.
ed, while Jesselton, the new
capital and the only other town
in North Borneo, lost 90% of its
buildings. Manila, once a fine
modern city, now lies in ruins ;
huge girders hang from stone
buildings, streets are still scarred
with battle, the fine University
of the Philippines and many
other colleges in the city may
never be rebuilt on their old
sites.
The toll of the destruction of
school buildings in South East
Asia is enormous. The almost
total loss of school equipment
and school supplies is common to
every country, with no exception.
The loss of books alone is a
catastrophic blow to education.
In fact the story of educational
losses in South East Asia is the
story of Europe all over again.
Such science teaching as there
was, and the teaching of science
is not yet far advanced in these
countries, is now almost at a
standstill for want of any equip-
ment.
But although t) te comparison
of looses produces very similar
pictures in the East and the
West, there are some assets in
eastern countries which help
them greatly in rebuilding edu-
cation. All these countrs have
a warm climate and perhaps the
people concerned in reconstruc-
tion hardly realize how great is
their good fortune. War strain,
however severe, is easier to re-
cover from in a lWarm and
relaxing climate, and this is par-
ticularly so with children. Child-
ren's clothing is not a problem.
European mothers search des-
perately for clothing to keep
their children and themselves
warm during the winter weather.
Schools often have to close for
several months because the child-
ren have not sufficient clothing
and the schools have no heating.
In the Far East there are no
such problems and the children
wear, if anything, the minimum
of clothing.
In all the countries visited
there has always been, through-
out the war, some kind of food
for the children ; not always
enough and not always the right
kind of food. but they have
never known real starvation.
Largely due to these two bles-
sings, a warm climate and food.
there is no real problem of"war-
handicapped children"as it 18
called in Europe. When the great
cities were bombed, mothers were
able to run with their children
into the jungle or surrounding
country-side and live there.
primitively, but indefinitely. And
the fact that they never endured
hunger over a long period 18
shown by the comparatively,
good health of the children.
Many of them have skin diseases
due to malnutrition, but very few
have been crippled by bombins
or have rickets and other disease*
through starvation.
And thirdly, all these countries
have Moot !, an invaluable gift.
In Burma, for instance, almoat
all the temporary schools are
built of bamboo. Evert the fur-
niture in some of the very poor
schools is made of bamboo.
Everywhere there are temporary
school bUildings,"mat sheds"aa
they are called. They will not
last long, not more than three to
five years and they cost five
times more to erect than they
would have before the war. But
at least they provide temporary
shelter from the sun and moat
of them even keep out the
tropical rains.
The greatest problem of re-
construction of all five countries
is the problem of teachers. In
each country the position was
found to be serious, in some the
solution is hard to see.
In every country visited Unesco
received the warmest welcome.
South East Asia has suffered
greatly in the war but is making
sallant efforts towards recons-
truction with, so far, little help
from outside. They greatly need
practical help and encouragement
and deserve every appreciation or
what they have already Mcom-
pllthed.
