In  the  past  year  since  the  July
1947 Conference,  I  have  had  occa-
sion  to  learn  with  what  genuine
eagerness many  countries  look  to
the  establishment  of  the  I. T. I.  In
twelve  of  them  have  given
fact, 
concrete  proof  of  this  by  consti-
tuting  national  centres  :

Austria,  Belgium,  Brazil,  Chile,
China,  Czechoslovakia,  France,
Italy,  Netherlands,  Switzerland,
United  Kingdom,  U. S. A.

Other  countries,  such  as. :  Argen-
tina,  Bolivia,  Denmack,  Ethiopia,
Greece,  Norway,  the  Netherlands,
Poland,  Sweden,  Uruguay,  New
Zealand  and  the  Philippines  are
in  various  stages  of  organization
of  their  national  centres.
