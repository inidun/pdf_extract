AT 

PESTALOZZI VILLAGE

Problems  of  war-handicapped
children  were  under  study  early
. this  month  at  a  Conference of
educators  and  psychologists from
nine  nations  in  Trogen, Switzer-
land.  The  week-long  meeting,
first  of  its  kind  since  the  war,
was  sponsored by Unesco and was
attended* by  some  twentv  dele-
, gates.

The  members, including  direc-
tors of children's villages, exchang-
: eoj views and  experiences on  the
re-integrating
best  methods  of

child  victims  of  the  war 
life.

will  form  the  basis'of &  study
of  war-handicapped youth  to  be
prepared by Unesco.

The  conference  held  general
sessions and  meetings under  two
commissions. The 
first  studied
the  material organization of  chil-
dren's  villages, problems of  staf-
fing,  financing  and  public  rela-

tions.  It  drew  up  plans  for  an
international  cordinatmg 
com-
mittee  which  will  assist in  rais-
ing  funds,  organizing  joint  pur-
chases, and  arranging  exchanges
of  staff  and  children,  and

The  second commission inves-
tigated the  content and  methods
of education provided in  the villa-
ges and  means of  re-integrating
children  into  normal  life.  These
entailed studies of  social and na-
tional  problems, provision of  fos-
ter  families, the  value of  psycho-
logical  and  psychotherapeutic
treatment  and  the  selection of
children.

The  Conference was  held  at
the  site of  the International  Pes-
talozzi  Village  for  war  orphans
(see Vol.  1, No. 4  of  the  Courier
for  a more complete story on  the
village).  The  Pestalozzi Village,
founded in  1946 to  care for  child
victims of  the  war, has been one
of  the most successful such exper-
iments.

Under the Presidency of Chaun-
cey  J.  Hamlin,  President of  the
International  Council  of  Mu-
seums,  the  Conference  studied
problems of  scientific  research,
the  training  of  museum person-
nel,  restoration  of  paintings  and
other  works of  art,  museums for
popular  education,  and 
techni-
ques and  materials  for  museum
exhibitions.

This  was  the  first  conference
since  the  war  in  most  fields  of
museum  activity,  and  the  first
international  museum conference
-  including  all  fields  of  museum
work-ever  held.  Results of  the
Conference are expected to  have
wide  influence, especially in  de-
veloping the  educational value of
museums and  in  advancing tech-
niques in  teaching  with  objects.
The  Conference  opened'at
Unesco House, and then separated
into  five  working  sections which
met  at  the  Ecole du  Louvre, the
Musée  de  1'Homme. the  Musée
Pedagogique, B ; bliothèque Natio-
nale  and  Palais  de  la  Decou-
verte  during  subsequent sessions.

Among  the  principal  addresses
were"A  Philosophy of  Museum
Education,"by  Dr.  Charles Rus-
sell  (USA),"Children's  Museums"
by Miss Margaret Brayton  (USA)
and"Mobile  Museums"by  Mr.
M. L. Ashton  (United  Kingdom).
The  delegates also heard  reports
by  M.  Edouard Michel  (France)
who  spoke  of"Museums 
and
Scientific  Research"in  the  field
of  art,  and  by  M.  A.  Leroi-Gou-

Eighty  Million 

Dollars

United  States  voluntary  agen-

lion  dollars  on  help  for  educa-

vastated  countries  during  1948,
according to  a  report from

During  1947, the  report  added,
similar  U. S.  aid  topped  eighty-
eight  million  dollars  compared
with  approximately sixty-two mil-
lion  raised in  1946.

Help  to  School.

The  C. I. E. R.'s report  to  Unesco
was drawn from  statements from
some 400 national  voluntary agen-
cies. A  further  115 agencies which
reported  the  year  before were so
far  unable  to  total 
funds
raised."It  may  therefore  be  as-
sumed,"the  Commission reported,
"that  American voluntary  efforts
this  year  are  at  least  keeping
pace with  and  are  probably sur-
passing those of  1947."

their 

Almost  the  whole  of  the  total
has been or will  be spent on  edu-
cational  materials  and  services.
Food, clothing and other basic re-
lief  accounted for  less than  five
million of the 1947 figure and were
supplied  solely  to schools  and
teacher groups.

Countries receiving the  aid  in-
cluded  Austria,  Belgium,  Bulga-
ria,  China,  Czechoslovakia, Den-
mark,  Finland,  France, Germany,
Greece, Holland,  Hungary,  Indo-
nesia, Italy,  Japan, Korea, Luxem-
bourg,  Norway,  Philippines,  Po-
land and Yugoslavia.

Many  contributions  were made
by  American  individuals  and  in-
stitutions  without  using  the  ser-
vices of  the  national  agencies re-
porting  to  the  Commission. These
contributions have totalled  about
eight  million  in  value  annually
since 1946.

Huxley  Stresses  Institute
Independence

Before  an  audience which  in-
cluded  the  Czech  Minister  of
Foreigh  Affairs,  Mr.  Vado  Cle-
mentis, and  Mr.  Zdenek Nejedly,
Czech  Minister  of  Education,
Dr.  Huxley stressed that  although
Unesco had worked to help create
the  new  organization, the  Insti-
indepenhent
tute  would  be  an 
organization

He declared that  the I. T. I, and
Unesco would  probably  draw  up
a  formal  agreement  for  close
cooperation and-with 
the  appro-
val of  the Third  Session of  Unes-
co's  General Conference-Unesco
might 
lend  financial  assistance
to  the  Institute  during  its  first
crucial  year. But  he  pointed  out
that 
the  Institute  woula  be  an
"independant,  autonomous inter-
national  body".

Seated on  the  flower-bedecked

stage of  the Grand Auditorium  of
the  Artists  House were Professor
Jean Thomas, Assistant Director-
General  of  Unesco,  Benjamin
Jedlicka  of  the  Czech Ministry
of  Foreign  Affairs,  Dr.  Huxley
and  Mr.  Maurice Kurtz,  Head of
Theatre  Affairs  at  Unesco  who
handled much of  the preparatory
work  for  the Institute.

A  Force  for  Peace
Mr.  Priestley  in  hiS speech
pointed  out  that  there  existed a
United  Nations fund  for  children
and that  he hoped the United Na-
tions  and  Unesco would  ensure
that  the Lot. !., a very new infant,
would  also not  starve.

Any  international  organization
crossing frontiers  was  at 
least
one  thread  in  the  fabric  of  a
world society. The attempt to link
theatres  together  and  to  ensure
that  people enjoyed the  best  of
the  world's è' !"ama showed a  mo-
vement towards international  un-
derstanding.

The  particular  nature  of  the
Theatre.  Mr.  Priestley continued,
compelled those concerned with  it
to  deal  with  human  beings con-
cretely  and  Intimately.  From  the
theatre,  people could  learn  how
