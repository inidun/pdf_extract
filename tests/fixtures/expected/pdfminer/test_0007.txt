AnimBI  Forms  and

The  history  of  painting 

is  very
old  in  Persia  but  by  no  means
easy  to  trace.  A  continuous 
tra-
dition 
the  Sassanian  period
may  be  traced  supported  by  sa-
tisfactory  evidence,  the  relics  of
which  are  to  be  found  most  abun-
dantly  in  12th  and  13th  Centuries.
The  most  striking  manifestations
of 
this  early  art  were  animal
forms  and  geometric  patterns.

Herzfeld  has traced  to Sassanians
many  wall  paintings  of  dancing
girls,  huntresses  and  floral  deco-
