I  called  on  ministries,  on

to  overcome  a
certain  amount  of  uneasiness  on
their  part  as  they  realized  they
were  being  requested  an  amount
of  research  and  compilation  of  in-
formation  which  was  often  con-
siderable.

To  my  mind. 

the  value  of  the

not  only  in  the  results  obtained,
nor  in  the  quality  of  the  answers
to  questionnaires  and  in  the  vari-

It 

is  to  be  found  also,  I  think,

raised  a  million  dollars  which

heavily  during  the  war.

Allocations  of  the  fund,  which
was  collected  by  some  seventy
voluntary  agencies  in  a  nation-
wide  campaign,  include :

to  elementary  and  secondary

school  supplies-$300,  000 ;

including  a
